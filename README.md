# Detection of Off-topic Responses in Automated Essay Scoring Using Semantic Similarity Measures
Implemented semantic vector extraction and similarity methods such as tf-idf similarity, Latent Semantic Analysis and Document Embeddings to detect off-topic responses using Random Forests/Gradient Boosted Trees on various datasets, achieving F1 scores of >0.9

LSA and document embeddings gave the best results, with prompt-specific off-topic responses performing better than response sets with broader definitions of off-topic. Models were compared by accuracy, F1 score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient.
